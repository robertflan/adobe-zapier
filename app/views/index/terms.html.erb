								<h4>Plain English Terms</h4>
								<p>We last updated this policy January 19, 2018.</p>
								<p>To use PDF ZapMe, you must agree you won’t use PDF ZapMe to break any local laws. You can’t republish or resell PDF ZapMe.
								</p>
								<p>You can use PDF ZapMe but that doesn’t mean you can copy or redistribute our intellectual property (like our trademarks, name, logo, source code, etc). Again, you have to follow your local laws when using PDF ZapMe.</p>

								<p>PDF ZapMe has a lot of user-submitted content (like our support forums, team accounts, developer platform, and Zap templates). By uploading content to PDF ZapMe, you are granting us certain license rights to that content. We may moderate this content or remove it at our discretion. Sometimes we will access your content in order to provide support or technical assistance.</p>

								<p>Please note that PDF ZapMe does not receive any rights in any information or data from your accounts with third party services (i.e., Gmail or Dropbox) that is passed through or is processed by PDF ZapMe, unless you choose to make it publicly available on PDF ZapMe.</p>
								<p>Back up your content! We do our absolute best to ensure against data loss but we can’t guarantee against it. It is always a good practice to regularly backup your data, regardless of whether you use PDF ZapMe. We encrypt everything where possible, but there may be times when data is communicated insecurely (for example email or an unencrypted API we work with).</p>
								<p>Our terms of service are effectively a contract between you and PDF ZapMe and are subject to termination and/or suspension, so make sure you read them.</p>
								<p>We feature partners and reviews on our website. We will ask your permission before using your name or photo. We normally contact people via email to obtain their permission.</p>

							<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12">
								<h4>Legal Terms</h4>
								<p>Date of Last Revision: January 19, 2018</p>
								<p>(a) Account and Use of Service: You may use your User Account for the Service only in accordance with these Terms of Service and only for lawful purposes. You are responsible for your own communications, including the upload, transmission and posting of information, and are responsible for the consequences of their posting on or through the Service.
								</p>
								<p>(b) Fees: Some features of the Service may only be accessed and used upon the payment of applicable fees (“Fees”). Fees may vary depending on usage in accordance with our current pricing policy. If you do not initially register for a version of the Service that requires the payment of a fee, you will nonetheless be permitted to use all of the features of the Service for a period of fourteen (14) days (“Free Trial Period”). Upon the expiration of the Free Trial Period, you will only be able to access and use those features of the Service the use of which does not require the payment of a Fee, unless you subsequently upgrade to a paid version of the Service. All Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.</p>
								<p>(c) Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading: Refunds are processed according to our fair refund policy. Any upgrade or downgrade in your Service use will result in the new Fees being charged at the next billing cycle. There will be no prorating for downgrades in between billing cycles. Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of features or capacity of your User Account. PDF ZapMe does not accept any liability for such loss.</p>
								<p>(d) Cancellation and Termination by You: You are solely responsible for properly canceling your User Account. An email or phone request to cancel your User Account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your User Account at any time by clicking on the settings link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The settings screen provides a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link. If you cancel your User Account before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately, and you will not be charged again. But there will not be any prorating of unused time in the last billing cycle.</p>
								<p>(e) Termination and Suspension by PDF ZapMe: PDF ZapMe may terminate your User Account and/or these Terms of Service at any time and for any reason upon notice to you. We may also suspend our Service to you at any time, with or without cause. If we terminate your User Account without cause, we will refund a prorated portion of your monthly prepayment. We will not refund or reimburse you if we terminate your User Account for cause, including (without limitation) for a violation of these Terms of Service. Once your User Account is terminated, we may permanently delete your User Account and all the data associated with it. If you do not log in to your User Account for 12 or more months, we may treat your User Account as “inactive” and permanently delete the User Account and all the data associated with it.</p>
